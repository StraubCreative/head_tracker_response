# head_tracker_response
Emergency response app that uses facial recognition to call 911

This web app's infrastructure is build based off the original HeadTrackr facial recognition application found
here: https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr

Head Tracker Response uses HeadTrackr event listeners so users can manipulate DOM elements using only head movements, thereby communicating via phone call using Twillio's open API.
