# head_tracker_response
Emergency response app that uses facial recognition to call 911

This web app's infrastructure is build based off the original HeadTrackr facial recognition application found here:
https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr

Head Tracker Response uses HeadTrackr event listeners for users to manipulate DOM elements using only head moments, and 
communicates through phone call using Trello's open API.
